sonatype account
----------------
https://issues.sonatype.org, chrisnappin/..
groupId = com.nappin


to publish locally
------------------
  activator + publish-local
or
  activator + publish-local-signed
  
- writes to $home\.ivy2\local\com.nappin\play-recaptcha_2.10\0.1-SNAPSHOT
        and $home\.ivy2\local\com.nappin\play-recaptcha_2.11\0.1-SNAPSHOT

(note: when example project resolves the jar locally, it creates eclipse config pointing directly
 to the local archive and Eclipse holds a file lock on this!)
 

to publish on Maven Central
---------------------------
sbt uses the standard Maven2 repository (http://repo1.maven.org/maven/ aka http://central.sonatype.org) by default
see http://mfizz.com/blog/2013/07/play-framework-module-maven-central
and http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html
and http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Using-Sonatype.html

Using the SBT PGP plugin, rather than using GPG itself
- added to project/plugins.sbt:
  addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-pgp" % "0.8.3")
  
- create PGP keys (in activator/play shell)
  set pgpReadOnly := false
  pgp-cmd gen-key
  
Name: Chris Nappin
email: chris@nappin.com
passphrase: ..
  
Public key := $home\.sbt\gpg\pubring.asc
Secret key := $home\.sbt\gpg\secring.asc

- then publish the public key:
  pgp-cmd send-key chris@nappin.com hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net/
(worked eventually, from work)

- add extra pom details needed for Sonatype (see build.sbt)

- created $home\.sbt\0.13\sonatype.sbt:
    credentials += Credentials("Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager",
                           "oss.sonatype.org",
                           "chrisnappin",
                           "..")

- run:
  activator + publish-signed 

(works fine from home)  
(in work, tried SBT_OPTS="-Dhttp.proxyHost=proxy.capita.zone -Dhttp.proxyPort=80" but still gave connection refused)
(also tried credentials property file format, still doesn't work)


workflow
--------
make test/beta releases to maven central using a "a.b-SNAPHOTS" version number
- this uploads artifacts to the "snapshots" repo (Maven Central only includes "full" releases)
- snapshots can be published several times (immediately overwrites)
- run "activator update" to explicitly refresh remote snapshot dependencies (otherwise it will try to cache locally)

make "full releases" using a regular version number (e.g. "a.b")
- this uploads artifacts to the "staging" repo
- releases cannot be published several times, have to be deleted first

?? then need to "drop"/"close" (delete release, try again later) or "release" (promote to maven central) the staging repository
- login to https://oss.sonatype.org (using sonatype user account above)
- click on Build Promotion -> Staging Repositories
    - look for groupId without dots and with -nnnn suffix
        - status should be "Open"
        - can manually download and test it
        - can select the repo and click "Close" to trigger evaluation
            - if fails, need to "Drop", resolve issues (see "Ruleset Evaluation Report") then redeploy to staging
            - if successful, click "Release" to move staging repo to release repo
            (first time you do this, need to update ticket to activate sync)

(sbt-sonatype plugin can be used to automate all of this - see https://github.com/xerial/sbt-sonatype)

- Maven central syncs to release repo, takes about 2 hours
    - cannot update or delete artifacts from this point!



to use module in example project
--------------------------------
add to build.sbt:

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.nappin" %% "play-recaptcha" % "0.1-SNAPSHOT" 
)

resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Snapshots" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/"
