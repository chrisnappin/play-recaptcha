Chris Nappin's play-recaptcha project todo list
===============================================

done for version 2.5
--------------------
- added support for Play 2.8.x+ (starting from PR from @gmixa)
- updated all dependencies


Google reCAPTCHA
----------------
My personal key is registered to nappin.com (but works with localhost)
Google development documentation is at https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/display


local dev env
-------------
Using sdkman to manage java, scala, sbt
Using java 11 (Guava has issues with 16)
Using scala 2.12.x and 2.13.x as in build.sbt (as supported by Play 2.8)
Using sbt 1.5.2 


to use sbt
----------
run "sbt" (to enter the shell) then run:

use: + <command> to build against all cross scala versions
use: ++ <version> <command> to use that specific version of scala

 clean
 compile
 test
 scalastyle (not scala 2.13)
 run

or

sbt clean coverage test
sbt coverageReport
(then see console or target/scala-2.x/scoverage-report/index.html)

to publish locally
------------------
run "sbt" (to enter the shell) then run:
 + publishLocal
or
 + publishLocalSigned
  
writes to ~/.ivy2/local/com.nappin/play-recaptcha_2.x/a.b (for each scala version)
 

to publish on Maven Central
---------------------------
sbt uses the standard Maven2 repository (http://repo1.maven.org/maven/ aka http://central.sonatype.org) by default
see http://mfizz.com/blog/2013/07/play-framework-module-maven-central
and http://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html
and http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Using-Sonatype.html

Using the SBT PGP plugin, rather than using GPG itself
- added to project/plugins.sbt:
  addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-pgp" % "0.8.3")
  
- create PGP keys (in activator/play shell)
  set pgpReadOnly := false
  pgp-cmd gen-key
  
Name: Chris Nappin
email: chris@nappin.com
passphrase: ..
  
Public key is pubring.asc
Secret key is secring.asc

- then publish the public key:
  pgp-cmd send-key chris@nappin.com hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net/
(command line said success, but sonatype or key search couldn't find it)
(manually uploaded contents from pubring.asc to https://a.keyserver.pki.scientia.net)

- add extra pom details needed for Sonatype (see build.sbt)

- created ~/.sbt/1.0/sonatype.sbt:
    credentials += Credentials("Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager",
                           "oss.sonatype.org",
                           "chrisnappin",
                           "..")

- run:
  sbt + publishSigned 

workflow
--------
make test/beta releases to maven central using a "a.b-SNAPHOTS" version number
- this uploads artifacts to the "snapshots" repo (Maven Central only includes "full" releases)
- snapshots can be published several times (immediately overwrites)
- run "sbt update" to explicitly refresh remote snapshot dependencies (otherwise it will try to cache locally)

make "full releases" using a regular version number (e.g. "a.b")
- this uploads artifacts to the "staging" repo
- releases cannot be published several times, have to be deleted first

?? then need to "drop"/"close" (delete release, try again later) or "release" (promote to maven central) the staging repository
- login to https://oss.sonatype.org (using sonatype user account above)
- click on Build Promotion -> Staging Repositories
    - look for groupId without dots and with -nnnn suffix
        - status should be "Open"
        - can manually download and test it
        - check contents includes all Scala versions
        - can select the repo and click "Close" to trigger evaluation
            (takes a couple of minutes)
            - if fails, need to "Drop", resolve issues (see "Ruleset Evaluation Report") then redeploy to staging
            - if successful, click "Release" to move staging repo to release repo
            (first time you do this, need to update ticket to activate sync)

(sbt-sonatype plugin can be used to automate all of this - see https://github.com/xerial/sbt-sonatype)

- Maven central syncs to release repo, takes about 2 hours
    - cannot update or delete artifacts from this point!

Then use Github Releases with changelog etc
Then update wiki with links to latest release
